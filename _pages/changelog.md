# Why This Works

This isn't a productivity app.

It's a way to act with clarity once per day — without pressure.

---

## One thing, on purpose

Doing one meaningful thing beats planning ten.

Attention is finite. Follow-through builds trust.

---

## Identity before action

You don't start with goals.

You start by choosing who you're being today.

Actions are small proofs of identity — not tasks to optimise.

---

## Values bias behaviour, not outcomes

The values here aren't targets or aspirations.

They gently shape how you act today — without comparison or metrics.

---

## No streaks. No guilt. No catch-up

Missed days don't break anything.

You simply choose again.

---

## Reflection closes the loop

You don't measure performance.

You acknowledge what counted.

---

## The principles behind this

This approach draws from well-established behavioural principles found in modern habit and psychology research — particularly the ideas that:

- identity shapes behaviour
- small actions compound
- intrinsic motivation outlasts pressure
- reflection reinforces consistency

The app applies these ideas quietly, without teaching or tracking them.

## If this feels too simple

That's intentional.

This app is for people who want fewer decisions —

and better ones.
